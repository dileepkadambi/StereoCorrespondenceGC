# StereoCorrespondenceGC
Implementation Of Stereo Correspondence  Using Graph Cut Technique 
This is done for term project where we intend to parallelize the Graph Cut Algorithm. 
The basic Sequential Implementation with OpenCV version 248 is given here. 
Instructions to Run the code:
To build and run this you will need OpenCV248, Visual Studio 2010.
Set environment variable PROJECTPATH to Place where OpenCV248 is set up.
Pull the code to the same location (Directory for this project should be present in the same directory OpenCV is setup in)
Build the solution present in build folder and ENJOY!
